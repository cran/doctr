## About

`doctr` is an R package that helps you check the consistency and the
quality of data.

The goal of the package is, in other words, automating as much as
possible the task of verifying if everything is ok with a dataset.
Like a real doctor, it has functions for examining,
diagnosing and assessing the progress of its "patients'".

Since `doctr` was created with the [Tidy Tools Manifesto](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html) in mind,
it works perfectly alongiside the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse).

## Creating dataset diagnostics with doctr

One of `doctr`'s main fuctions is `diagnose()`, which runs tests
(nicknamed "exams") on a table to check if its variables pass certain
standards and fit certain assumptions.

After running `diagnose()`, we can use the `issues()` function
to get a report about the results of the exams.

Let's see how this works with an example dataset: `ggplot2::mpg`.

```{r}
# Runninng exams on table
diagnostics <- diagnose(mpg)
```

Now the `diagnostics` object contains all the errors found while diagnosing
the `mpg` dataset. By using `issues()` we can get human-readable reports on these
errors.

```{r}
# Getting summary of diagnostics
issues(diagnostics)
```

Since `mpg` is already very well-formed, no issues were found. I'm going
to artificially break the table so we can see what issues look like (I'm
also turning `verbose` on so the function shows exactly what the issues were).

```{r}
# Manually breaking mpg
mpg2 <- mpg %>%
  mutate(year = as.Date(year, origin = "1970-01-01"))

# Getting summary of diagnostics
mpg2 %>% diagnose() %>% issues(verbose = TRUE)
```

As we can see, `diagnose()` was able to parse `year`, but it alerted us
that it isn't a character variable.

### Creating custom exams

`diagnose()` by default uses a function called `guess_exams()` to generate
the exams it is going to run on a given table. This special function
grabs a sample of the table and tries to assign each of its variables to
one of the types below (from most to least restrictive):

* `percentage`: must be only numeric values between 0 and 1
* `money`: must be positive values and have at most 2 decimal places
* `count`: must be positive integers
* `quantity`: must be positive values
* `continuous`: must be numeric values
* `categorical`: must be factors
* `character`: must be text

If you run `guess_exams()` by yourself, you can customize the exams it
generates and then pass them as an argument to `diganose()` so that it uses
you custom exams.

Let's see how this works in practice.

```{r}
exams <- guess_exams(mpg)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(exams)
```

Each columns in `exams` can be filled with a parameter that is going to be
used by `diagnose()` to find problems in `mpg`. These are the meanings of these
parameters and to what variable types they apply (for more information on
types, run `vignette(doctr_examine)`):

| parameter | numeric | text | factor | description |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `funs` | x | x | x | which type should be used for base exams (`percentage`, `money`, etc.) |
| `max_na` | x | x | x | maximum % of NAs |
| `min_val`, `max_val` | x |  |  | minimum and maximum values |
| `max_dec_places` | x |  |  | maximum number of decimal places |
| `min_unq`, `max_unq` |  | x | x | minimum and maximum number of unique classes |
| `least_freq_cls` |  | x | x | minimum % of the total a class can represent |

Let's customize these exams and use them with `diagnose()`.

```{r}
# Setting some arbritraty maximum and minimum values
exams$max_val[8] <- 30
exams$min_val[9] <- 15

# Setting least frequent class
exams$least_frec_cls[10] <- 0.2

# Setting maximum unique classes
exams$max_unq[1] <- 10

# Use custom exams to diagnose table
mpg %>% diagnose(exams) %>% issues()
```

Using the `i` parameter of `issues()` paired with `verbose`,
we can pass the name or index of a column in order to get only
the issues associated with it.

```{r}
# Use custom exams to diagnose table
diagnostics <- diagnose(mpg, exams)

# Get results for 1st column
issues(diagnostics, i = 1, verbose = TRUE)

# Get results for fl column
issues(diagnostics, i = "fl", verbose = TRUE)
```
