## About

`doctr` is an R package that helps you check the consistency and the
quality of data.

The goal of the package is, in other words, automating as much as
possible the task of verifying if everything is ok with a dataset.
Like a real doctor, it has functions for examining,
diagnosing and assessing the progress of its "patients'".

Since `doctr` was created with the [Tidy Tools Manifesto](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html) in mind,
it works perfectly alongiside the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse).

## Exploring datasets with doctr

One of `doctr`'s main fuctions is `examine()`, which gets the
summary statistics for every column of a table, varying the
summarization strategy depending on the type of variable.

After running `examine()`, we can use the `report_*()`
family of functions to get the different types of reports back.
`report_num()` is used for numeric varibales, `report_txt()` for
text variables and `report_fct()` for factor variables.

Let's see how this works with an example dataset: `ggplot2::mpg`.
For the sake of this example, I'm going to transform the `class`
column into a factor.

```{r}
# Converting class to factor
mpg$class <- as.factor(mpg$class)
```

Now we have 3 main types of variables represented in this table: numeric,
text and factor. When we run `examine()`, the function is going to treat
each column differently depending on in which of these groups it fits; if it
can't classify the column, `examine()` always defaults to text.

```{r}
# Creating the EDA
eda <- examine(mpg)
```

With the `eda` object we can get all 3 exploratory analyses.

```{r}
# Getting report of numeric variables
report_num(eda)

# Getting report of text variables
report_txt(eda)

# Getting report of factor variables
report_fct(eda)
```

The tables produced are very wide, so I won't show them here in their integrity, but
the names of the columns in the reports are codes for each summary
statistic; here's what each of them mean and in which reports they
come up:

| column | numeric | text | factor | description |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `name` | x | x | x | name of the variable |
| `min`, `max` | x | x |  | minimum and maximum value/length |
| `1%`, ..., `99%` | x | x |  | value/length percentiles |
| `mean` | x | x |  | mean value/length |
| `sd` | x | x |  | value/length standard deviation |
| `na`, `val` | x | x |  | percentage of missing and non-missing entries |
| `neg`, `zero`, `pos` | x |  |  | percentage of negative, zero and positive values |
| `unq` | x | x |  | count of unique values/texts |
| `mdp` | x |  |  | maximum number of decimal places |
| `asc` |  | x |  | equals 1 if the text is identified as ASCII |
| `ltr`, `num` |  | x |  | percentage of text that is identified as letters and numbers |
| `data` |  |  | x | each factor level |
| `cnt`, `frq` |  |  | x | count and frequency of each level |

### Grouping

Like with a `group_by()` statement, it is also possible to divide the
table before getting the EDA. We do this with the `group` argument of the
`examine()` function and then collect the results with the same argument of
the `report_*()` family.

```{r}
# Creating the EDA (grouped by the class variable)
eda <- examine(mpg, group = "class")
```

For `examine()`, `group` receives the name or index of a column.
When collecting the reports, `group` receives the level of the
grouped variable from which we want the results.

```{r}
# Getting report of numeric variables for compact cars
report_num(eda, group = "compact")

# Getting report of text variables for SUVs
report_txt(eda, group = "suv")

# Getting report of factor variables for midsize cars
report_fct(eda, group = "midsize")
```
